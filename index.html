          <p>
            I think that people in their lifes should do what 
            they really want to do. 
            So, I like programming, I interested in front-end 
            development and my life aim is to become a software 
            engineer.
            I have a critical mindset and can easily learn something
            new, especially in IT sphere. I am able to analyze 
            problems and find optimal solutions for them. 
            And yes, writing summaries is not my strong side :)
